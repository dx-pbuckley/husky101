Not that you fully trust it to be that effective; the tech of this tank is decades old. Your employer was just too cheap to update anything, especially for the lowly scouting team. \n Well, you're going to die here. How wonderful. This is exactly how you imagined a career as a planetary scientist to go. You love dying. Really. \n You're getting bored. Dying takes a long time.

You reach up and pull down the lid, revealing the flickering displays lining the outside: static runs through the main dashboard, disrupting an empty vitals display; red text flashes at the top of the dashboard, SYSTEMS ERROR: EMERGENCY REVIVAL. \nYou wonder what made your capsule short out. You suppose that the systems are old enough that it shouldn't come as a surprise; your company is always loathe to give the scouting operations the funding they need. They prefer to keep their money concentrated in corporate. Never mind that the mining operations are their real source of revenue. Selfish bastards."

Two capsules have completely dark displays, two others look about as they should, and the last – \nThe last capsule is open."

None of the functions of the capsule seem to be working; the stasis liquid of both is too still, congealed fluid rimming the half-drained tanks. You peer through the crusted lid of the tank and have to take a step back. Your crewmate, a materials scientist, peers up at you with half-lidded, vacant eyes. Her ashen, water-logged face has its own gravity, pulling your eyes back to it when you try to look away. This was her first mission. She shook your hand and told you that this was her first opportunity to apply her schooling. You force yourself away from her capsule. Her casket now. \nYou move on to the other darkened capsule, prepared now for what you'll find. It's the pilot's face that looms out at you now, oddly discolored through the filter of the stasis liquid. He was charming man from what you'd seen of him, but more importantly, he was your ticket out of here. Hopefully you'll be able to put out a distress call without him; you know the pilot held the majority of the ship's access codes. All systems on board can be accessed with his fingerprint, where other crew members have more limited access. Two of your crewmates are dead; hopefully, neither are your chances at getting out of here."

It seems that the capsule has executed its self-cleaning routine, and no residue remains in the tank. There are towels scattered about the base of the capsule, gone stiff as the viscous stasis liquid dried them into their contorted shapes. You pull down the capsule lid, revealing a dark screen. It does not respond when you try to touch it."
    open_thought = "You remember the occupant of this capsule. He was a mechanic, there to make sure the company's ships don't break down. Which they do anyways, but that's not his fault. Though, he was reassigned to your mission at the last moment, and you've heard there have been…problems with his past assignments. And, why is his the only capsule that seems to be in perfect condition? This seems suspicious. \nWell, even if he has nothing to do with these strange malfunctions, you should probably find him. Maybe he'll have insight into what crippled the stasis bay."
